# The 5 stages of programming
1. ~~Defining the problem.~~ "That can't happen"
2. ~~Planning the solution.~~ "That doesn't happen on my machine"
3. ~~Coding the program.~~ "That shouldn't happen on my machine"
4. ~~Testing the program.~~ "Why does that happen?" 
5. ~~Documenting the program.~~ "How did this ever work?"
